Stack Music Player
Music notes contained in a stack and reads abc music file and plays corresponding notes

The programmer must create a stack that will be implemented with an array. The header file must contain a struct called stack with three data elements.
These data elements are the stack pointer, an array index that will mark the position in the stack, the a pointer called buf and a variable of type integer
called size. The song that will be played in this program is Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.
